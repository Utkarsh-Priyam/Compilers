# Compilers and Interpreters
This is my repository for all things related to the compilers and interpreters class I took in 11th grade.

The repository will be updated to back up my work and reflect my work path through (and before) the class.
##
This repository is completely in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).
##
This repository is public but will only be updated sporadically.

There may be some mild swearing (in commit names, JavaDoc, etc.). If you don't like it find another public compilers and interpreters repository.
