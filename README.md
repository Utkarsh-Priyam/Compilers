# Compilers and Interpreters
This is my repository for all things related to the compilers and interpreters class I took in 11th grade.

The repository will be updated to back up my work and reflect my work path through (and before) the class.
##
This repository is completely in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

This course is [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) only. However, if someone is inspired by the course or this repository and writes this code base in another popular language such as [python](https://www.python.org/) or [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/), please let me know so that I can set up a link to it.
##
This repository is public but will only be updated sporadically.

There may be some mild swearing (in commit names, JavaDoc, etc.).
##
This repository can be used as a reference on how a basic compiler and/or interpreter could be set up.

By accessing this repository, you agree to take any and all responsibility for any consequences that may arise from accusations of plagiarism or theft. Do NOT copy any code from this repository.
